# Guides vs Procedures vs Fixes

Procedures related to a piece of software or a service will usually go under that page. This Procedures tab is usually for items that are general such as workstations, emergency or backup procedures, testing and auditing, etc.

## A Fix

    - Fixing something that's broken
    - Not expected to be done regularly
    - Has specific symptoms which can be addressed by a solution or workaround
    - Addressing a deviation from normal or expected behaviour

## A Guide

    - Is something not generally required for the network or systems to function
    - More user specific, similar to the distinction between 'preferences' and 'settings'
    - More like a "how to" get setup in your workspace, or something similar
    - Usually only needing to be done once (unless getting a new device for example)

## A Procedure

    - Often a regular task
    - Usually planned or known in advance
    - Part of the job
    - Expected to be repeated more than once, or regularly
    - Whose steps could be considered to stay the same over each repetition
